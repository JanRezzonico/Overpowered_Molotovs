# Overpowered Molotovs
This is a simple mod for Payday 2 that gives the user more molotov throwables and makes them more powerful.

SuperBLT is required to run this mod.

This mod is meant to be used only in singleplayer or in a private lobby. Using this mod in public lobbies is not recommended as it is technically cheating.

# Installation
1. Download the latest version of the mod
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `PAYDAY 2` mods folder.
3. Launch the game and enjoy

# Note
After some time, the burning effect will stop, but the molotov will still deal damage.

For this reason it is suggested to use the [Unambiguous Molotovs mod](https://modworkshop.net/mod/31396) to make the affected area visible.
